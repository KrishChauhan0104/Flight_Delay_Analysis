# Flight Delay Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to analyze and predict flight delays based on various features like airlines, time of day, airports, and other factors. We leverage machine learning models to predict if a flight will be delayed and use exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the reasons for delays.

### Features:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on flight delay patterns.
- **Flight Delay Prediction Model** using **Logistic Regression**.
- Visualizations of delay patterns across airlines, times of the day, and airports.
- Utilizes **scikit-learn** for machine learning and **Pandas/Seaborn** for data processing and visualization.
